## Unit Testing in PHP

In this project, I added unit tests to an existing application to ensure that it is functioning as intended. The project is a directory of PHP Conferences. I also used an existing test case to add a new feature: A listing image function. I completed the project by using XDebug to generate a code coverage report.
